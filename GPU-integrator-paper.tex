\begin{abstract}
A fifth-order implicit Runge--Kutta method and two fourth-order exponential integration methods equipped with Krylov subspace approximations were implemented for the GPU and paired with the analytical chemical kinetic Jacobian code \texttt{pyJac}.
The performance of each was evaluated by integrating thermochemical state data sampled from stochastic partially stirred reactor simulations and compared with the commonly used CPU-based implicit integrator \texttt{CVODE}.
The implicit Runge--Kutta method performed over five times faster on a single GPU than \texttt{CVODE} on a single six-core CPU for an \ce{H2}\slash\ce{CO} model, and up to \SI{31.5}{\percent} faster than \texttt{CVODE} for the GRI-Mech 3.0 model.
The exponential integration techniques performed less efficiently for all cases.
The main limiter of GPU integrator performance was identified as thread divergence, and techniques to mitigate this issue were discussed.
A novel shared memory caching strategy for the GPU was developed and shown to provide a \SIrange{5}{24}{\percent} performance increase to all GPU-based integrators.
Additionally, an issue affecting storage of the chemical kinetic Jacobian in per-thread local memory was identified and work-around methods were discussed.
Finally, future research directions were identified based on the current state-of-the-art of stiff chemical kinetics integration on the GPU.

The need for accurate chemical kinetic models in predictive reacting-flow simulations has driven the development of detailed oxidation models for hydrocarbon fuels relevant to transportation and energy generation applications.
At the same time, growing understanding of hydrocarbon oxidation processes resulted in orders of magnitude increases in model size and complexity.
For instance, a recently developed model for 2-methylalkanes, relevant for jet and diesel fuel surrogates, includes over 7000 species and 30000 reactions~\cite{Sarathy:2011kx} while a recent detailed gasoline surrogate mechanism contains over 1500 species and 6000 reactions~\cite{Mehl:2011jn}.
Furthermore, kinetic models for large hydrocarbon fuels tend to exhibit high chemical stiffness that requires implicit integration algorithms for efficient solution.
The cost of these algorithms scales at best quadratically---and at worst cubically---with the number of species in a model~\cite{Lu:2009gh}.
Lu and Law~\cite{Lu:2009gh} extensively reviewed techniques to accelerate chemical kinetics integration.
In addition to the methods discussed in their work, significant effort has also been directed towards improvements of the integration algorithms.

Reactive-flow modeling codes commonly rely on high-order implicit integration techniques to solve the stiff governing equations posed by chemical kinetic models.
These methods require repeated evaluation and factorization of the chemical kinetic Jacobian matrix in order to solve the associated nonlinear algebraic equations through iterations of linear system solutions---the cost of which scales quadratically and cubically, respectively, with the number of species in a mechanism.
However, significant cost savings in the Jacobian evaluation can be realized by using an analytical formulation, rather than the typical evaluation via finite difference approximations.
This approach eliminates numerous chemical source term evaluations, and for a sparse Jacobian (e.g., formulated in terms of species concentrations) the cost of evaluation drops to a linear dependence on the number of species in the mechanism~\cite{Lu:2009gh}.

In this work, our efforts to accelerate chemical kinetics focus on improving the integration strategy itself, via development of new algorithms and use of high-performance hardware accelerators such as graphics processing units (GPUs) and other similar single instruction multiple data (SIMD) devices.
Central processing unit (CPU) clock speeds increased regularly over the past few decades---commonly known as Moore's Law---however, power consumption and heat dissipation issues slowed this trend recently.
While multicore parallelism somewhat increased CPU performance, recently SIMD processors gained popularity as a low cost, low power consumption, and massively parallel high-performance computing alternative.
GPUs were originally developed for graphics\slash video processing applications and consist of hundreds to thousands of separate cores, compared with the tens of cores found on typical CPUs.
The SIMD parallelism model differs from a traditional CPU-based multithreading model, with small per-core memory caches and acceleration resulting from executing the same instruction over multiple data.
Subsequently, the SIMD parallelism model requires extra consideration for efficient use in chemical kinetic acceleration.

In this study, the NVIDIA CUDA framework~\cite{Buck:2008aa,NVIDIA:2015aa} was used, hence the following discussion will use CUDA terminology; however the concepts within are widely applicable to SIMD processing.
The basic parallel function call on a GPU, termed a kernel, is broken up into a grid of thread blocks.
A GPU consists of a number of streaming multiprocessors (SMs), and the thread blocks in the grid are assigned to a SM, typically with multiple blocks assigned to a single SM.
The SMs further subdivide the blocks into groups of \num{32} threads called warps, which form the fundamental CUDA processing unit.
The resources available on a SM (memory, cores, registers, etc.) are split between the warps from all the assigned blocks.
The threads in a warp are executed in parallel on CUDA cores, with multiple warps typically being executed concurrently on a SM.
Thread-divergence, a key performance concern for SIMD processing, occurs when the threads in a warp follow different execution paths, e.g. due to if\slash then branching.
In this case, the divergent execution paths must executed serially, causing a slowdown.
Further, as compared to a typical CPU, GPUs have relatively small memory caches and few registers available per SM.
These resources are further split between all the blocks\slash warps running on that SM.
Overuse of these resources can cause slow global memory accesses for data not stored locally in-cache or can even reduce the number blocks being assigned to each SM.
The performance trade-offs of various CUDA execution patterns are quite involved and beyond the scope of this work, for more details we refer the interested reader to several works that discussed these topics in depth~\cite{Cruz:2011gc,Brodtkorb:2013hn,Niemeyer:2014hn}.
Instead we will briefly highlight key considerations for CUDA-based chemical kinetic ODE integration.

The extent of thread-cooperation within a CUDA-based chemical kinetic ODE integration algorithm is a key point that shapes much of implementation.
Typically GPU accelerated chemical kinetic solvers follow either a ``per-thread'' pattern~\cite{Niemeyer:2011aa,Stone:2013aa,Niemeyer:2014aa}, in which each individual GPU thread solves a single set of chemical kinetic ODEs, or a ``per-block'' approach\cite{Stone:2013aa,Sewerin20151375}, in which all the threads in a block cooperate to solve a single set of chemical kinetic ODEs.
The greatest potential benefit of a per-thread approach is that a much larger number of ODEs can theoretically be solved concurrently; typically the number of blocks that can be executed concurrently on each SM is $\sim$8, whereas typical CUDA launch configurations in this work consist of 64 threads per block, or 512 of sets ODEs solved concurrently per SM.
The much larger amount of parallelism available in a per-thread approach is not without drawbacks however.
For instance as the memory available per SM must now be split between many more sets of ODEs, a per-thread approach may encounter more cache-misses, resulting in expensive global memory loads.
Further, as different threads may follow different execution paths within the ODE integration algorithm itself the performance of a per-thread approach can be greatly impacted by thread divergence~\cite{Stone:2013aa,Niemeyer:2014aa}.
For this reason, implicit integration algorithms, which typically have complex branching and evaluation paths, may suffer more from thread divergence when implemented on a per-thread basis than relatively simpler explicit integration techniques~\cite{Stone:2013aa}.
Conversely, thread-divergence is typically less of a concern for integrators following a per-block strategy as the execution path of each thread is planned by design of the algorithm.
Further, a per-block approach has significantly more local cache memory and registers available for solution of a set of ODEs, and thus memory access speeds and cache size are less of a concern.
However, in our experience efficient use of these resources requires significant hand-tuning for optimization, making it more difficult to generalize the developed algorithm between different chemical kinetic models (a key feature for potential non-academic applications).
Finally we note that past work has shown that in the best-case scenario, elimination of the majority of thread divergence by choice of identical initial conditions, the performance of a per-thread implicit integration algorithm greatly surpassed that of the per-block implementation of the same algorithm~\cite{Stone:2013aa}.

A number of studies in recent years explored the use high-performance SIMD devices to accelerate (turbulent) reacting-flow simulations.
Spafford et al.~\cite{Spafford:2010aa} investigated using GPUs to accelerate a turbulent combustion direct numerical simulation code, demonstrating a sub-order of magnitude speedup in evaluating the species production rates on the GPU.
Shi et al.~\cite{Shi:2011aa} used a GPU to evaluate species rates and factorize the Jacobian for the integration of independent kinetics systems, showing order-of-magnitude or greater speedups for large kinetic models.
Niemeyer et al.~\cite{Niemeyer:2011aa} implemented an explicit fourth-order Runge--Kutta integrator for the GPU, and found a speedup of nearly two orders of magnitude with a nonstiff hydrogen mechanism.
Shi et al.~\cite{Shi:2012aa} implemented a stabilized explicit solver for the GPU and paired it with a CPU-based implicit solver that handled integration of the most-stiff chemistry cells in a three-dimensional premixed diesel engine simulation, demonstrating an overall speedup of \numrange{2}{3}$\times$.
Le et al.~\cite{Le2013596} implemented GPU versions of two high-order shock-capturing reacting flow codes, and found a \numrange{30}{50}$\times$ speedup over the baseline.
Stone and Davis~\cite{Stone:2013aa} implemented the implicit VODE~\cite{Brown:1989vl} solver for the GPU and achieved an order of magnitude speed-up over the baseline CPU version.
Additionally, they showed that the implicit VODE algorithm exhibited significant thread divergence, as expected due to its complicated program flow (compared with an explicit integration scheme).
Furthermore, Stone and Davis~\cite{Stone:2013aa} showed that for $\sim$\num{e4} independent ODEs or more, a per-thread implementation outperformed a per-block version of the same algorithm; the per-block implementation reached its limit speedup earlier ($\sim$\num{e3} ODEs), however for large scale reacting flow simulations with (typically) millions of cells, this is not a concern.
Niemeyer and Sung~\cite{Niemeyer:2014aa} demonstrated an order-of-magnitude speedup for a GPU implementation of a stabilized explicit second-order Runge--Kutta--Chebyshev algorithm over a multicore CPU implementation of VODE for moderately stiff chemical kinetics.
They also investigated levels of thread divergence due to differing integrator time-step sizes, and found it negatively impacts overall performance for dissimilar ODE initial conditions in a thread-block.
Sewerin and Rigopoulos~\cite{Sewerin20151375} implemented a three-stage\slash fifth-order implicit Runge--Kutta method~\cite{wanner1991solving} on a one-block per ODE basis on GPU, and found a \num{1.8}$\times$ slowdown at best compared with the same on a single eight-core CPU.

While increasing numbers of studies have explored GPU-based chemical kinetics integration, there remains a clear need to find or develop integration algorithms simultaneously suited for the SIMD parallelism of GPUs (along with similar hardware accelerators) and capable of handling stiffness.
In this work we will investigate GPU implementations of several explicit and implicit integration techniques, as compared to their CPU counterparts and the baseline CPU \texttt{CVODE}~\cite{Hindmarsh:2005hg} algorithm.
Several previous works~\cite{Perini20141180,McNenly2015581} suggested so-called matrix-free methods---which do not require direct factorization of the Jacobian, but instead use an iterative process to approximate the action of the factorized Jacobian on a vector---as potential improvements to the expensive linear-system solver required in standard implicit methods.
Furthermore, Hochbruck and Lubich~\cite{Hochbruck:1997} demonstrated that the action of the matrix exponential on a vector obtained using Krylov subspace approximation converges faster than corresponding Krylov methods for the solution of linear equations.
Others previously explored these so-called explicit exponential methods for applications in stiff chemical systems~\cite{Bisetti:2012jw,falati2011integration} and found them stable for time-step sizes greatly exceeding the stability bound.
In addition, their explicit nature makes them potentially much better suited for SIMD acceleration due to an expected reduction of thread divergence (for a per-thread implementation) compared with implicit methods.
Finally, the three-stage\slash fifth-order implicit Runge--Kutta algorithm~\cite{wanner1991solving} investigated by Sewerin and Rigopoulos~\cite{Sewerin20151375} will be studied to determine the impact of increasing chemical stiffness on the algorithm and the performance benefits of using an analytical Jacobian matrix, such as that developed by Niemeyer et al.~\cite{Niemeyer:2015im,Niemeyer:2015ws}.

In Section~\ref{S:method}, the methods and implementation details of the algorithms used in this paper will be laid out.
Subsequently, in Sec.~\ref{S:results} the performance of the algorithms run using a database of partially stirred reactor conditions will be presented and discussed, with particular focus on the effects of thread-divergence and the potential impacts of current state of the art GPU accelerated chemical kinetic evaluation for large-scale reacting flow simulations.
Finally in Sec.~\ref{S:conclusions}, the results of this work will be used to identify the most promising future directions for GPU\slash SIMD accelerated chemical kinetic integration.

In this section, we discuss details of the algorithms implemented for the GPU along with third-party software used.
The generation of testing conditions will be discussed briefly, and a shared memory caching algorithm will be outlined.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Integration techniques}

We investigated GPU implementations of three integration methods in this work, comparing them against equivalent CPU versions and a CPU-only implicit algorithm.
While we describe important details or changes here, full descriptions of all algorithms may be found in the cited sources.
The \texttt{pyJac} software~\cite{Niemeyer:2015im,Niemeyer:2015ws} provided both chemical source term and analytical Jacobian subroutines for CPU- and GPU-based algorithms.
To evaluate the relative performance impact of use of a finite-difference Jacobian (as compared to an analytical Jacobian) for both platforms, a first-order finite difference method based on that used by \texttt{CVODE} was used; the chemical source term methods used in the finite difference Jacobian were provided by \texttt{pyJac} in all cases.
For validation and performance assessments of \texttt{pyJac}, we direct readers to our previous work~\cite{Niemeyer:2015ws}.

First, we used the \texttt{CVODE} solver~\cite{Hindmarsh:2005hg} to provide the baseline performance of a typical CPU-based (maximum of fifth-order) implicit integration technique.
In addition, we implemented CPU versions of the methods under investigation for direct comparison to the high-order implicit technique.
These include the three-stage/fifth-order implicit Runge--Kutta algorithm~\cite{wanner1991solving}, called \texttt{Radau-IIA} here; the fourth-order exponential Rosenbrock-like method \texttt{exp4} of Hochbruck et al.~\cite{Hochbruck:1998}; and the newer fourth-order exponential Rosenbrock method~\cite{Hockbruck:2009}, called \texttt{exprb43} here.
For the exponential methods, we used the method of rational approximants~\cite{gallopoulos:1992} paired with the Carath\'edothy--Fej\'er method~\cite{trefethen:2006} to approximate the action of the matrix exponential on a vector, as suggested by Bisetti~\cite{Bisetti:2012jw}.
This technique relied on the external \texttt{FFTW3} library~\cite{frigo2005design}.
However, unlike the approach of Bisetti~\cite{Bisetti:2012jw}, we developed a custom routine based on the algorithm presented by Stewart~\cite{stewart:1998} to perform LU decomposition of the Hessenberg matrix resulting from the Arnoldi iteration.
Convergence of the Arnoldi iteration algorithm was computed using the second term of the exponential matrix\slash vector product infinite series, as suggested in several works~\cite{Bisetti:2012jw,saad:1992}.
The exponential integrators used a rational approximant type of $\left(10,10\right)$ as suggested by Bisetti~\cite{Bisetti:2012jw}
To ensure high performance of CPU-based methods, the Intel \texttt{MKL} library version 11.3.2 handled linear algebra (i.e., BLAS/LAPACK) operations.
Next, we implemented GPU versions of the \texttt{Radau-IIA}, \texttt{exp4}, and \texttt{exprb43} methods; these follow the same descriptions as the CPU versions, but required specialized implementations of several BLAS and LAPACK methods, mostly related to LU factorization of the Jacobian or Hessenberg matrices.
All GPU routines were developed using the NVIDIA CUDA framework~\cite{Buck:2008aa,NVIDIA:2015aa}.
The \texttt{Radau-IIA} solver as developed by Hairer and Wanner~\cite{wanner1991solving} contains an adaptive time-stepping technique, the exponential methods used a standard adaptive time-stepping technique~\cite{wanner1991solving} (pg. 28--31); adaptive time-stepping was handled internally by the \texttt{CVODE} solver.
Finally, the adaptive time stepping procedures of all integrators used absolute and relative tolerances of \SI{e-10} and \SI{e-6}, respectively, throughout the work.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Testing conditions}
\label{S:pasr_conditions}

In order to measure the performance of the integrators for realistic conditions, a database of thermochemical states covering a wide range of temperatures and species mass fractions was generated using a previously developed constant-pressure stochastic partially stirred reactor (PaSR) code~\cite{Niemeyer:2015ws}.
We selected two chemical kinetic models to span the range of model sizes typically used in high-fidelity simulations: the \ce{H2}\slash\ce{CO} model of Burke et al.~\cite{Burke:2011fh} with 13 species and 27 reactions, and the GRI-Mech 3.0 model with 53 species and 325 reactions~\cite{smith_gri-mech_30}.
The PaSR simulations were performed at the conditions listed in Table~\ref{T:pasr_parameters} for 10 residence times to reach a statistical steady state; Niemeyer et al.~\cite{Niemeyer:2015ws} described the PaSR simulation process in greater detail, which follows approaches used by others~\cite{Chen:1997ta,Pope:1997wu,Ren:2014cd}.
The PaSR particles were initialized using the equilibrium state, and gradually move away from equilibrium conditions due to mixing\slash inflow \slash outflow.
In order to not influence the solution runtime trends for small numbers of ODEs, the first \num{1000} conditions, were removed from each database.
This corresponded to a single $\tau_\text{pair}$; at this point in the simulation, $\sim\SI{20}{\percent}$ of the conditions were no longer near-equilibrium temperature, and by the \num{5000}th condition $\sim\SI{80}{\percent}$ of the states were no longer near-equilibrium.

\subsection{Shared memory caching}
\label{S:smem_present}

A unique memory-access pattern is one aspect of the GPU platform particularly important to high-performance algorithms; each streaming multiprocessor can access only a small amount of fast cache memory (typically \SI{64}{\kilo\byte}) and \SI{32}{\bit} registers (typically \SIrange{32}{64}{\kilo\byte}).
All other memory is stored globally on the device, with comparatively high latencies.
Thus, it is critical to properly use cache memory to achieve maximum performance on GPUs.
When formulated on a per-block basis, GPU-based integration algorithms typically use this memory to store commonly used values such as the current state vector and  chemical Jacobian.
However, on a per-thread basis, the best use of this memory is less clear; this section proposes one approach for efficient use of this fast memory.

Using fast memory on a per-thread basis poses a challenge: it must be split between all threads in the blocks resident on a streaming multiprocessor.
This fast memory is further split into an L1 cache and shared memory available for interthread communication within a block.
Most versions of the CUDA compute standards allow the user to specify the relative allocation of the L1 cache and shared memory pool.
In our preliminary studies, a larger L1 cache proved the superior choice for our per-thread approach; the inherent increased memory traffic quickly overwhelms the small cache memory, resulting in slower global memory accesses.
However, this left $\sim$\SI{16}{\kilo\byte} of the cache memory as shared memory, with only around two to four double-precision variables available per thread.
This small amount of available memory is challenging to use in the integration algorithm itself; however, evaluation of the chemical source terms and analytical Jacobian present opportunities for using the shared memory.

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The presented~\hyperref[A:shared_mem_caching]{algorithm} describes a strategy to use this available shared memory to store commonly used species concentrations during evaluation of the reaction rates.
Similar algorithms were developed for the species net production rates and Jacobian evaluation routines, using frequently updated species net production rates and frequently used reaction rates\slash species concentrations as the cached variables, respectively.
As this algorithm runs during generation of the source code for the various subroutines, it introduces no computational or memory overhead related to determining the caching structure during runtime.
Although this represents a relatively simple improvement, its use can achieve reasonable performance benefits, as will be seen in Sec.~\ref{S:smem}.

  \label{F:convergence}
\end{figure}

To investigate the correctness of the developed solvers, the first \num{10000} conditions in the \ce{H2}\slash\ce{CO} database were integrated by each solver for \SI{e-6}{\second}.
The error for condition $i$ was then determined using the weighted root mean square error:
\begin{equation}
 E_i(t) = \left\lVert\frac{y_i(t) - \hat{y}_i(t)}{\text{atol} + \hat{y}_i(t) \cdot \text{rtol}}\right\rVert_2
\end{equation}
where the $y_i(t)$ is the solution obtained from the various solvers, and $\hat{y}_i(t)$ is the ``true'' solution obtained via \texttt{CVODE} using a global time-step of $\delta t = \num{e-10}$ and absolute\slash relative tolerances of \num{e-20} and \num{e-15} respectively.
The maximum error over all conditions:
\begin{equation}
 \left\lvert\textbf{E}\right\rvert = \max_{i=\num{1}\dots\num{10000}}\{E_i(t)\}
\end{equation}
was then used to measure convergence.
The solvers used the same tolerances as for the performance testing (absolute\slash relative tolerances of \num{e-10} and \num{e-6} respectively).
Adaptive time-stepping was used in all cases, and Krylov subspace approximation was enabled for the the exponential integrators thus evaluating the accuracy of the solvers, in identical form as used for performance testing.
The global integrator time-step was varied from \SI{e-6}{\second} to \SI{e-11}{\second} to examine convergence to the true solution.

Figure~\ref{F:convergence} shows the convergence plot for the CPU solvers.
The error of the \texttt{Radau-IIA} integrator is far below the specified integration tolerances (which are achieved in the ideal case for $\left\lvert\textbf{E}\right\rvert = 1$) for all cases.
The exponential solvers exhibit much larger levels of error for the larger global time-step, with $\left\lvert\textbf{E}\right\rvert \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$ for the largest global time-step.
As the time-step size is decreased two factors affect the overall error.
First, the internal integration step-size was not held constant but instead allowed to vary adaptively, hence this is only a ``true'' convergence plot for the smaller time-steps where the global integrator time-step is smaller than any step-size taken by the adaptive scheme.
In conjunction, the convergence of the Arnoldi algorithm is affected by the internal integration step-size (the error estimate is scaled by the internal step-size).
To study the effect of the Arnoldi algorithm on the overall error, Fig.~\ref{F:convergence} also presents the convergence of the exponential integrators with the Krylov approximation error reduced to far below that of the error of the overall method.
Practically, this is accomplished by detecting when the $n$th Krylov subspace vector approaches zero, a condition known as the ``happy breakdown'' in literature~\cite{datta2010numerical}.
In this limit, the approximate exponential matrix\slash vector product approaches the exact value (within machine precision) and thus the error induced by the Krylov approximation is negligible.
In Fig.~\ref{F:convergence} is it seen that with the approximate Krylov subspace, the exponential methods achieve only first order convergence to the true solution, however with the ``exact'' Krylov subspace both methods achieve second-order convergence.
Although both methods are nominally forth order, the combination of chemical stiffness and adaptive time-stepping reduces the apparent convergence to order two.
However, from Fig.~\ref{F:convergence} we may conclude that all solvers produce reasonably accurate solutions as compared to \texttt{CVODE}.
Additionally, although not shown, the results for the GPU solvers are largely identical.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We studied the performance of the integrators by testing each on the PaSR conditions described in Sec.~\ref{S:pasr_conditions} for two different global integration time-step sizes representative of those used in large eddy and Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes simulations: $\delta t = \SI{e-6}{\s}$ and $\delta t = \SI{e-4}{\s}$, respectively.
Furthermore, the use of a larger global time step induces additional stiffness for a given model and enables evaluation of integrator performance at varying stiffness levels.
Runtimes are reported as the average over five runs, where each run started from the same set of PaSR conditions.
While the computed runtimes exhibited some variations, we chose to omit error bars from the plots for clarity; in general, the implicit methods exhibited variations within \SI{\pm3}{\percent} and the exponential methods within \SI{\pm1}{\percent}.\todo{recheck}
All CPU integrators were compiled using \texttt{gcc 4.8.5} (with the compiler options ``\texttt{-O3 -funroll-loops -mtune=native}''), and were executed in parallel via OpenMP on four ten-core \SI{2.2}{\giga\hertz} Intel Xeon E5-4640 v2's with \SI{20}{\mega\byte} of L3 cache memory.
OpenMP was used to parallelize on a per-condition basis, that is each individual OpenMP thread was responsible for integration of a single set of chemical kinetic ODEs, rather than cooperation between OpenMP threads to solve the same.
A six-core \SI{2.67}{\giga\hertz} Intel Xeon X5650 was used as the host CPU for the GPU integrators, which were compiled using \texttt{nvcc 7.5.17} (with compiler options ``\texttt{-arch=sm\_20 -O3 -maxrregcount 63 -{}-ftz=false -{}-prec-div=true -{}-prec-sqrt=true -{}-fmad=false}'') and run on a single NVIDIA Tesla C2075 with \SI{6}{\giga\byte} of global memory.
Reported runtimes for the GPU-based algorithms include time needed for CPU--GPU data transfer before and after each global time step; in addition, the function \texttt{cudaSetDevice()} was used to initialize the GPU before timing to hide any device initialization delay.
The open-source \texttt{pyJac} software~\cite{Niemeyer:2015im,Niemeyer:2015ws} produced CPU and GPU custom source-code functions for the chemical source terms and analytical Jacobian matrix evaluation.
All of the GPU performance results shown in this section used the shared memory caching algorithm discussed in Sec.~\ref{S:smem_present}, the benefit of which will be discussed in Sec.~\ref{S:smem}.

\subsection{Performance}

The runtimes in this section were normalized by the number of ODEs solved for all cases.
The reasoning behind this presentation is two-fold.
First, saturation of the available computational resources becomes visually apparent (transition from a linear decrease to a flat trend), and secondly, certain other performance trends (e.g. the effects of thread-divergence) are easily highlighted.
The presentation of the performance data in raw form has been been made available in the supplementary materials for completeness.\todo{do this!}

  \caption{Average runtimes of the integrators on the CPU\slash GPU for the \ce{H2}\slash\ce{CO} model at two different global time-step sizes.}
  \label{F:H2_perf}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{F:H2_perf} shows the runtimes of the CPU and GPU integrators for the \ce{H2}\slash\ce{CO} model.
In Fig.~\ref{F:h2_cpu_perf_small} the runtimes per ODE for the CPU integrators with a global time-step of $\delta t=\num{e-6}$ are seen to decrease approximately linearly with the number of ODEs for small numbers of ODEs (shown here on a log-log plot).
Around \num{e3} ODEs, the CPU resources begin to be saturated, and the the runtime per ODE levels off to a more constant value.
For small numbers of ODEs, the exponential integrators are seen to outperform the implicit integration techniques.
This phenomena is due to the ordering of the states in the PaSR database, which starts with $\sim$\num{e2} chemical kinetic states at near-equilibrium conditions. \todo{re-run without this, so we don't have to explain}
Further states in the PaSR database begin to be significantly more diverse due to inflow\slash mixing\slash outflow processes, and thus exhibit more stiffness.
As more states far from equilibrium begin to be encountered, the performance of the implicit integration techniques catches up and eventually surpasses that of the exponential integrators.
For large numbers of conditions, \texttt{CVODE} is the most efficient solver on the CPU, however the other solvers are of relatively similar efficiency in this case.
Fig.~\ref{F:h2_gpu_perf_small} shows the performance of the GPU integrators for the same global time-step.
A similar trend is exhibited, with an linearly decreasing solution cost, that reaches a roughly constant value at $\sim$\num{e4} ODEs.
However, as the number of conditions is increased, significantly different behavior from the CPU case is observed, with large jumps in solution cost for various numbers of ODEs.
As Fig.~\ref{F:h2_cpu_perf_small} does not show increased solution cost at the corresponding locations, it can be surmised that these increased costs are due to thread-divergence, rather than increased chemical stiffness.
This pattern of thread-divergence, which will be explored further in Sect.~\ref{S:divergence}, is exhibited for all GPU integrators in this work.
Interestingly, the \texttt{Radau-IIA} solver is not nearly as negatively affected by thread-divergence in this range as the exponential integrators.
This suggests that the implicit solver either already has significant levels of thread-divergence and thus addition of further thread-divergence has less of an impact (similar to the findings of Stone et al.~\cite{Stone:2013aa}), or that the extra stiffness encountered simply does not cause the same level of thread-divergence as in the exponential integrators.
This will be further explored in Sect.~\ref{S:divergence}.

Figures~\ref{F:h2_cpu_perf_large} and \ref{F:h2_gpu_perf_large} show the performance of the integration algorithms on both platforms for the \ce{H2}\slash\ce{CO} model with the larger global time-step ($\delta t=\num{e-4}$).
The performance of the CPU integration algorithms behave roughly similar to the smaller time-step case, decreasing in cost per ODE before reaching a more constant performance for higher numbers of ODEs.
One key difference from the smaller time-step case is that the larger global time-step induces additional chemical stiffness; as a result the implicit integrators are more efficient, as seen between $\sim$\SIrange{e5}{e6} ODEs.
Again \texttt{CVODE} is the most efficient solver for large numbers of ODEs.
Fig.~\ref{F:h2_gpu_perf_large} shows the performance of the GPU solvers for the larger time-step.
At $\sim$\num{e2} ODEs, a significant spike in cost is observed for the exponential solvers, and is mirrored by a much smaller increase in cost for the implicit \texttt{Radau-IIA} solver.
As only a very modest performance decrease is seen at corresponding number of ODEs for the CPU solvers, we may surmise that this phenomena is due to primarily to thread-divergence rather than stiffness.
The \texttt{Radua-IIA} solver is more efficient for all cases, but does appear to run into some performance degradation due to thread-divergence for the largest initial condition sets.

% The CPU \texttt{Radau-IIA} integrator was at best \SI{14}{\percent} faster than \texttt{CVODE} (at \num{65536} ODEs) and at worst \SI{16}{\percent} slower (at \num{32768} ODEs) for the smaller global time-step size.
% In the best case for the larger global time-step size, the CPU \texttt{Radau-IIA} solver was at best \SI{3.8}{\percent} slower than \texttt{CVODE} (\num{32768} ODEs) and \SI{35}{\percent} slower at worst (\num{16384} ODEs).
% For the smaller time-step size, the GPU \texttt{Radau-IIA} integrator was at best \num{5.31}$\times$ faster than \texttt{CVODE} (\num{16384} ODEs) and \num{3.45}$\times$ faster in the worst case (\num{900900} ODEs).
% Using the larger time-step size negatively impacted the performance of the GPU \texttt{Radau-IIA} integrator---at best it ran \SI{32}{\percent} slower (\num{524288} ODEs) than \texttt{CVODE}, and was \SI{69}{\percent} slower in the worst case (\num{65536} ODEs).
% At the smaller time-step size the GPU \texttt{exprb43} integrator was at best \SI{30}{\percent} faster than its CPU counterpart (\num{262144} ODEs) and was \SI{13}{\percent} faster at worst (\num{32768} ODEs). 
% The GPU \texttt{exp4} solver was \SI{23}{\percent} faster than the CPU version at best (\num{262144} ODEs), and \SI{32}{\percent} slower in the worst case (\num{32768} ODEs).
% Although the \texttt{exprb43} and \texttt{exp4} algorithms only require three exponential matrix function approximations, a single time step of \texttt{exprb43} is more expensive due to the extra chemical source term evaluations, matrix multiplications, and higher-order exponential matrix function requirement.
% As such, the relatively simpler CPU \texttt{exp4} integrator outperformed the CPU \texttt{exprb43} integrator at the smaller time-step size: by \SI{22}{\percent} in the best case (\num{900900} ODEs) and \SI{44}{\percent} in the worst case (\num{65536} ODEs).
% However, the nominal fourth-order convergence of the \texttt{exp4} algorithm is a classical nonstiff order, and thus order reduction is expected for stiff problems~\cite{ANU:7701740,Bisetti:2012jw}.
% Correspondingly, for the more stiff, larger time-step size case, the CPU \texttt{exprb43} outperformed \texttt{exp4} by \SIrange{32}{33}{\percent} for all cases.

  \caption{Average runtimes of the integrators on the CPU\slash GPU for the GRI-Mech 3.0 model at two different global time-step sizes.}
  \label{F:CH4_perf}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{F:CH4_perf} shows the runtime of the integrators for the GRI-Mech 3.0 model.
Similar to the \ce{H2}\slash\ce{CO} case for the smaller time-step, the CPU exponential integrators are seen to be more efficient (Fig.~\ref{F:ch4_cpu_perf_small}) for the near-equilibrium conditions at the beginning of the database.
For larger numbers of conditions, the implicit integrators are more efficient with \texttt{CVODE} having the best performance.
As compared to the \ce{H2}\slash\ce{CO} case, there is more separation between the performance of the exponential and implicit integrator performances for the small time-step, indicating higher stiffness levels.
The performance gap between the two integrator classes is even bigger for the CPU integrators with the larger time-step (Fig.~\ref{F:ch4_cpu_perf_large}) reaching nearly an order of magnitude difference in some cases.
Further, the CPU implicit solvers are roughly an order of magnitude slower for both time-steps as compared to the \ce{H2}\slash\ce{CO} cases.
This phenomena, due largely to the increase in problem size, is mirrored by the \texttt{Radau-IIA} GPU solver for the smaller time-step.
For the larger time-step size however, the performance of the \texttt{Radau-IIA} GPU solver decreases roughly two orders of magnitude as compared the the \ce{H2}\slash\ce{CO} case.
The GPU exponential solvers again are highly negatively impacted by thread-divergence in both cases as for \ce{H2}\slash\ce{CO}, the combination of increased stiffness and thread-divergence makes them significantly less efficient for the larger step-size.

% The GPU \texttt{Radau-IIA} integrator outperformed \texttt{CVODE} for the smaller time-step size; at best, it ran \SI{31.5}{\percent} faster than \texttt{CVODE} (\num{131072} ODEs), and at worst was \SI{10}{\percent} faster (\num{16384} ODEs).
% The larger time-step size again negatively impacted the performance of the GPU-based \texttt{Radau-IIA} integrator, dropping the performance to \num{8.63}$\times$ slower than \texttt{CVODE} at best (\num{32768} ODEs), and \num{20.5}$\times$ slower in the worst case (\num{450900} ODEs).
% For the smaller time-step size the CPU \texttt{Radau-IIA} integrator was \SI{13}{\percent} faster than \texttt{CVODE} at best (\num{131072} ODEs) and \SI{10}{\percent} faster at worst (\num{450900} ODEs).
% The larger time-step size---the stiffest case---was the only case where \texttt{CVODE} significantly outperformed CPU \texttt{Radau-IIA}, which was \num{2.66}$\times$ slower at best (\num{65536} ODEs) and \num{4.11}$\times$ slower at worst (\num{450900} ODEs).
% This difference may be due to the adaptive-order nature of the \texttt{CVODE} algorithm, or potentially due to its maturity and years of optimization.
% However, this effect is fairly minor and should not cause the order-of-magnitude decrease in relative performance between the GPU-based \texttt{Radau-IIA} integrator and \texttt{CVODE} observed when switching to the larger time step.

\subsection{Effect of Thread Divergence}
\label{S:divergence}
Two primary factors affect the performance of the GPU integration algorithms: chemical stiffness and thread divergence.
To investigate this further, we adopted a similar quantification of thread divergence to that of Niemeyer and Sung~\cite{Niemeyer:2014aa}:
\begin{equation}
	D = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{32}{d_i}}{32 \max_{i \in 32} d_i} \;,
	\label{eqn:divergence}
\end{equation}
where $d_i$ is the number of internal integrator time steps taken to reach the global time step by thread $i$ in a warp (which consists of 32 threads).
$D$ represents the similarity of internal time step counts across threads in a warp---the most significant source of thread divergence.
If all threads in a warp use identical internal integration time steps and thus the warp experiences no thread divergence from this source, then $D = 1$; however, if a warp experiences an unbalanced number of internal integration time steps, then $D$ will tend to zero.

  \caption{Thread divergence measure of the \texttt{Radau-IIA} solver for both models and time-step sizes.}
  \label{F:divergence}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{F:divergence} shows the distribution of the divergence measure $D$ for the \texttt{Radau-IIA} solver with both time-step sizes and kinetic models when run on \num{65536} ODEs, spread across \num{2048} warps.
For both kinetic models, increasing time-step size resulted in a sharp increase in the number of warps with large thread divergence (i.e., $D < 0.5$).
This implicates thread divergence, rather than chemical stiffness, as the main performance limiter for the GPU-based \texttt{Radau-IIA} integrator.
Furthermore, increased thread divergence likely caused the relative performance difference of the GPU \texttt{Radau-IIA} solver between the \ce{H2}\slash\ce{CO} and GRI-Mech 3.0 models at the smaller time-step size.
This observation motivates future work aimed at developing strategies to reduce thread divergence.
Potential solutions include adoption of an ODE per-block approach~\cite{Stone:2013aa}, reordering of ODEs to increase similarity of stiffness inside a warp, or time-step synchronization between threads in a warp.

Figure~\ref{F:GRI_perf} also shows that the CPU exponential integrators are typically only \numrange{2}{3}$\times$ slower than \texttt{CVODE} for the smaller time-step size.
As the exponential integrators must only factorize a smaller Hessenberg matrix (e.g., $5 \times 5$ for small integrator time-step sizes in stiff cases) rather than the entire Jacobian---as in implicit integrators---significant savings in factorization can potentially be achieved for larger mechanism sizes.
At larger integrator time-step sizes without severe chemical stiffness (e.g., near equilibrium), the size of the Hessenberg matrix to be factorized typically grows to $20\times 20$.
However, as stiffness increases, e.g., as for the larger time-step size, the stability characteristics of the implicit integrators make them more favorable.
We hypothesize that the exponential integrators may be more efficient than the implicit integrators for moderately stiff systems (e.g., with small time-step sizes, or low tolerances) with larger chemical mechanisms.
Prior work~\cite{Niemeyer:2014aa} showed that stabilized explicit integrators can provide significant speedups for moderately stiff systems.
Although not shown in Fig.~\ref{F:divergence}, the GPU exponential integrators experienced significant thread divergence in all cases, and thus would also likely benefit from the thread divergence reduction techniques discussed above.

\subsection{Effect of a Finite-Difference based chemical kinetic Jacobian}
It is well established that use of an analytical Jacobian can significantly accelerate chemical kinetic integration on the CPU~(e.g. \cite{Lu:2009gh,stone2014comparison}), to our knowledge no work utilizing an analytical Jacobian for GPU-based chemical kinetic integration has been published.
To this end, in this section we explore the use of a first-order finite-difference based Jacobian on the GPU and compare the relative performance benefits of the analytical Jacobian to those achieved on the CPU.
As the exponential methods are formulated for use with exact Jacobian (rather than approximate finite-difference based Jacobians), their performance was not considered during this section.
Figure~\ref{F:AJ_comp} shows the speedup achieved on the CPU for \texttt{CVODE} and on both the CPU\slash GPU for the \texttt{Radau-IIa} algorithm for various cases.
For the \ce{H2}\slash\ce{CO} model, the performance benefit from use of the analytical Jacobian is fairly minimal for the CPU based integrators (speedup of $\sim\mathcal{O}(1))$; this is due to both the relatively small size of the model which results in modest chemical source term evaluation cost, and lower chemical stiffness resulting in only a few Jacobian evaluations for the implicit algorithms.
Indeed in Fig.~\ref{F:AJ_ch4_small} we see that the speedup reaches \SIrange{2}{3}{$\times$} for the larger, more stiff GRI-Mech 3.0 model.
In contrast, the performance of the analytical Jacobian based GPU \texttt{Radau-IIA} solver is significantly better than its finite-difference counterpart in all cases.
The reasons for this result are two-fold, first the cost of repeated chemical source term evaluations is relatively more expensive on GPU due to the limited on-chip memory and subsequent expensive global memory accesses.
Second, and more importantly, the effects of thread-divergence greatly exacerbate this increased chemical source term evaluation cost.
To see this, we compare Figs~\ref{F:AJ_h2_small} and \ref{F:AJ_ch4_small} to Fig.~\ref{F:AJ_h2_large}.
Based on the results presented in section~\ref{S:divergence}, roughly similar levels of thread-divergence are expected for both models at the smaller time-step, while significantly more thread-divergence is evident for both models with the larger time-step.
As the finite-difference Jacobian evaluation on the GPU is relatively more costly, we therefore expect a large drop in efficiently due to thread divergence as the SM will be underutilized if only a few threads require Jacobian updates.
Correspondingly, speedups of $\sim\mathcal{O}(10\times$) are observed for both models with the smaller time-step, while much larger speedups, $\sim\mathcal{O}(100\times)$, are observerd for the \ce{H2}\slash\ce{CO} model with the larger time-step.

\subsection{Effect of shared memory caching}
\label{S:smem}

The effectiveness of the shared memory caching scheme was evaluated in several cases by comparing the mean runtime of the integrators using chemical source terms and analytical Jacobian subroutines generated with and without the caching algorithm enabled.
We observed typical speedups of $\SI{5}{\percent}$ and $\SI{10}{\percent}$ for the smaller and larger global time-step sizes, respectively.
This difference resulted from an increase in chemical source term and Jacobian evaluations required for the larger time-step size cases.
Even larger speedup factors were observed in certain cases with the GRI-Mech 3.0 model: a \SI{24.4}{\percent} speedup with \texttt{exp4} for \num{131072} ODEs and the \SI{e-6}{\second} time-step size, and a \SI{13.2}{\percent} speedup with \text{Radau-IIA} for \SI{32768} ODEs and the \SI{e-4}{\second} time-step size.
Thus, we recommend using this or a similar caching scheme in order to exploit shared memory in GPU integrators implemented on a per-thread basis.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The large size and chemical stiffness of chemical kinetic models relevant to fuels for transportation and power generation traditionally requires the use of high-order implicit integrators for efficient solutions.
Past work showed orders-of-magnitude speedups for solution of nonstiff to moderately stiff chemical kinetic systems using explicit solvers on GPUs.
In contrast, work on stiff chemical kinetic integration with implicit GPU solvers has been limited to specialized cases, or failed to surpass current CPU-based techniques.

This work demonstrated the performance of GPU-based integration methods, including an implicit fifth-order Runge--Kutta algorithm and two fourth-order exponential integration algorithms, using chemical source term and analytical Jacobian subroutines provided by the \texttt{pyJac} software~\cite{Niemeyer:2015im}.
For time-step sizes relevant to large eddy simulations, the GPU-based implicit Runge--Kutta method achieved a maximum speedup of over five compared with the CPU-based implicit \texttt{CVODE} integrator on a six-core CPU for an \ce{H2}\slash\ce{CO} model, and outperformed \texttt{CVODE} for the GRI-Mech 3.0 model by up to \SI{31.5}{\percent}; the exponential integrators performed worse in all cases.
For longer time-step sizes, the performance of all GPU solvers decreased significantly due to increased levels of thread divergence.
Furthermore, a shared-memory caching algorithm was developed for the evaluation of chemical source terms and the analytical chemical Jacobian, and resulted in modest performance benefits of \SIrange{5}{24}{\percent} speedup.
In addition, an issue was identified with storage of the Jacobian and similar matrices in per-thread local memory.

When compared with the results of a similar integration technique by Sewerin and Rigopoulos~\cite{Sewerin20151375}, our results showed that using an analytical chemical Jacobian matrix greatly improves implicit integration speeds on the GPU.
Further improvements to the analytical Jacobian code, e.g., by use of a chemical kinetic system based on species concentrations rather than mass fractions, are likely to further increase performance of the developed algorithms.
However, this work clearly showed that thread divergence poses the largest challenge to high performance of GPU-based integration techniques on a per-thread basis.
Therefore, our future work will focus on developing methods to mitigate or eliminate these effects.
Finally, new integration techniques such as hybrid implicit\slash explicit solvers, and selection of appropriate solvers based on estimated chemical stiffness, will be investigated.
