\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Intro}

The need for detailed, accurate chemical kinetic models for predictive reacting-flow simulations has driven the developement of large hydrocarbon oxidation models for transport and energy relevant fuels.
At the same time, the growing understanding of the hydrocarbon oxidation process has resulted in orders of magnitude growth in mechanism size and complexity.  
For instance, a recently developed 2-methylalkane model, relevant for jet and diesel fuel surrogates, consists of over 7000 species and 30000 reactions \cite{Sarathy:2011kx} while a recent detailed gasoline surrogate mechanism contains over 1500 species and 6000 reactions \cite{Mehl:2011jn}.
Further, large hydrocarbon fuels tend to exhibit high levels of chemical stiffness \cite{Lu:2009gh}; the solution cost of which scales at best quadratically, and at worst cubically with the number of species in a mechanism \cite{Lu:2009gh}.

Consequently, a number of techniques have been developed to accelerate chemical kinetic integration.
These can be roughly categorized as: skeletal mechanism reduction and removal of unimportant species and reactions \cite{Lu:2005,Lu:2006bb,Lu:2008bi,Pepiot-Desjardins:2008,Niemeyer:2010bt,Niemeyer:2014,Curtis:2015aa,rabitz_sa,turanyi_sa_1,turanyi_sa_2,vajda_pca,valorani_csp2,valorani_csp}, time-scale analysis 
\cite{qssa,pe_approx1,pe_approx2} and dimensional reduction \cite{Lam:1993ub,Lam:1988wc,Lam:1994ws,Lu:2001ve,ildm}, and tabulation and interpolation of expensive terms \cite{Pope:1997wu,prism,Christo1996}.
In addition to these cost-reduction methods, significant work has been directed towards improvements of the integration algorithmns themselves.

Typically to solve the highly stiff set of governing equations associated with transport and fuel relevant chemical kinetics mechanisms, high-order implicit integration techniques are used.
These methods require repeated evaluation and factorization of the chemical kinetic Jacobian matrix in order to solve the associated non-linear algebraic equations during iteration, the cost of which scale quadratically and cubically with the number of species in a mechanism.
However, significant cost savings can be realized in Jacobian evaluation through the use of an analytic formulation, rather than the typical evaluation via a finite difference approximation.
This approach eliminates the numerous right-hand side function evaluations, and the cost of Jacobian evaluation drops to a linear dependence on the number of species in the mechanism \cite{Lu:2009gh}.
Several analytical Jacobian matrix codes have been developed \cite{Safta:2011vn,Youssefi:2011tm,Bisetti:2012jw,Perini:2012gy,Dijkmans:2014bb}, but the recently released \texttt{pyJac} \cite{Niemeyer:2015im,Niemeyer:2015ws} software is the only open-source analytical chemical kinetic Jacobian tool capable of both generating code for new SIMD processor types, as well as handling newer pressure dependence formulations (e.g. pressure-log or Chebyshev rate formulations).

Another research thrust has been aimed at evaluation of new integration algorithmns, specifically targeted at exploiting the power of high-performance hardware accelerators such as the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and other similar single-instruction multiple-data devices.
Central processing units (CPU) clock speeds have increased regularly--commonly known as Moore's Law--over the past few decades, however power consumption and heat dissapation issues have slowed this trend recently.
While multiple-core parallelism has increased CPU performance somewhat, recently SIMD processors have gained popularity as a low-cost, low-power and massively parallel high-performance computing alternative.
GPUs were originally developed for graphics/video processing and consist of hundreds to thousands of separate cores, compared to the tens of cores found on typical CPUs.
The SIMD parallelism model operates by performing identical operations on many different sets of data at the same time, and is thus well suited for the operator-splitting chemical intergration model that forms the basis of many reactive-flow codes\cite{Oran:2001aa}.
However, if the SIMD processor must perform different operations, e.g. due to a if/then branching statement, slowdown occurs as the differing operations must be performed serially.
This issue, known as thread divergence, is a key perfomance parameter for SIMD devices, and has been a limiting factor for efficient implementations of implicit integration algorithmns for SIMD devices.

A number of studies in recent years have explored the use high-performance SIMD devices for acceleration of turbulent reacting flow simulations.
Spafford et al. \cite{Spafford:2010aa} investigated the use of GPUs to accelerate S3D \cite{CHEN:2009s3d} a turbulent combustion direct numerical simulation code; they found around an order of magnitude speedup for evaluating the species production rates on the GPU.
Shi et al. \cite{Shi:2011aa} used the GPU for evaluation of species rates and Jacobian factorization and similarly large speedups when evaulating the rates or factorizing Jacobians on the GPU.
Niemeyer et al. \cite{Niemeyer:2011aa} implemented an explicit fourth-order Runge-Kutta integrator for the GPU, and found a speedup of nearly two orders of magnitude with a hydrogen mechanism.
Shi et al. \cite{Shi:2012aa} implemented a stabilized explicit solver, and paired it with a CPU based implicit solver which handled integration of the stiffest chemistry cells in a three-dimensional homogenous charge compression ignition engine simulation, domonstrating a 2-3$\times$ speedup.
Le et al. \cite{Le2013596} implemented a GPU version of two high-order shock-capturing reacting flow codes, and found a 30-50$\times$ speedup over the baseline 
Stone et al. \cite{Stone:2013aa} implemented the implicit VODE \cite{brown1989vode} solver for the GPU and achieved an order of magnitude speed-up over the baseline CPU version.
Additionally, it was found that that having each GPU thread solve one independent chemical kinetic ODE, rather than having a block of GPU threads cooperate to solve a single ODE, was generally faster when the number of ODEs was large \cite{Stone:2013aa}.
Niemeyer et al. \cite{Niemeyer:2014aa} found over an order of magnitude speedup for an implementation of a stabilized explicit second corder Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev algorithmn over a CPU implementation of VODE for moderately stiff chemical kinetics.
Sewerin et al. \cite{Sewerin20151375} implemented a 3-stage/5th order implicit Runge--Kutta method on a one-block per ODE basis, and found a maximum 5$\times$ speedup.

In this work we will investigate
